# Go L - gRPC & Protocol Buffers Project

## Overview
This project is built using **Go** and **gRPC**, following concepts from the Udemy course: *NEW-Comprehensive Go Bootcamp with gRPC and Protocol Buffers*. It covers everything from Go basics to advanced topics, including Protocol Buffers and gRPC.

## Features
- Comprehensive implementation of Go concepts
- REST API and gRPC API development
- Advanced concurrency handling with GoRoutines and Channels
- Integration with SQL and NoSQL databases (MongoDB, MariaDB)
- TLS/SSL implementation for secure APIs
- Middleware development from scratch
- API benchmarking with tools like `wrk`, `h2load`, and `ghz`

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (latest version)
- [Protocol Buffers Compiler](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) (`protoc`)
- gRPC Go module: `go get google.golang.org/grpc`
- Database dependencies (MongoDB, MariaDB)

## Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/go-l.git
